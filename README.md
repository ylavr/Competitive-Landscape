# Competitive-Landscape
My goal was to identify key competitors and understand the factors contributing to their success or struggles compared to Ironhack.

I designed, created, and populated a database with information on coding schools that compete with Ironhack. Additionally, I developed SQL queries to answer important business questions, which I defined based on the data available.

Key steps I took to start the project:

Expanded the dataset by including a wider variety of coding schools and identifying their unique IDs.
Reviewed the scraped data frames to identify relevant dimensions, metrics, and keys that could be used to connect the data frames.

Database Schema and Queries
I wrote SQL queries to create the necessary tables and populate them with data. I executed these queries using Python connectors to ensure the data was properly structured for analysis.

Expected Improvements
To further enhance the project, I also focused on:

Deepening the business analysis by collecting more comprehensive data such as:

Additional coding schools, locations, and user reviews.
New data sources such as demographic data or salary information by region.
Formulating multi-layered business questions based on the initial data analysis.
Utilizing visualizations to enhance the presentation and support the business analysis.
